The Watchmen - comprised of the Comedian, Dr. Manhattan, Nite Owl II, Ozymandias, Rorschach and Silk Spectre II - are a disparate band of masked superheroes, modeled after the Minutemen, who were masked superheroes of a generation earlier, most of who are dead or afflicted by the ravages of life. The Comedian belongs to both groups. Despite the activities of the Watchmen leading to the west winning the Vietnam War which in turn has kept Richard Nixon in the White House, Nixon has now outlawed masks, resulting in the Watchmen disbanding and going into retirement, most hiding their Watchmen past under their human identities. However, the Comedian, in his human persona of Eddie Blake, and Dr. Manhattan - former physicist Jon Osterman who obtained his superhero powers through a scientific accident which almost killed him - now work for the government. Dr. Manhattan's powers in particular have kept a watch over nuclear proliferation, as he is able to stop any nuclear attack. Regardless, the Cold War is at its height with recent Soviet posturing regarding nuclear bomb buildup. In her human persona of Laurie Jupiter, Silk Spectre II is Dr. Manhattan's assistant and lover, as much as they can be in Dr. Manhattan's now non-human state. Meanwhile, Ozymandias has come out to the world as wealthy genius Adrian Veidt, capitalizing on his Ozymandias identity to better the world, and Rorschach continues to work as a vigilante, although one wanted by the law despite he the reason that many criminals are behind bars. When Blake is murdered, Rorschach, as the only one still on the streets, believes the murderer is out to kill all the Watchmen, despite any number of people wanting to kill the Comedian for being a misogynist. Evidence points to it perhaps having something to do with an imminent attempt of nuclear annihilation. Rorschach has to convince his colleagues, who he has not seen since their superhero days, of the validity of his theory for them to come out of retirement, which is no easy task. If they do, which will require them to overcome external forces which seem to be conspiring against them, they will have to discover both who killed the Comedian and why before they befall the same fate as him and/or before the mastermind is able to exact his larger grand plan.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "12 wins & 24 nominations", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2IzNGNiODgtOWYzOS00OTI0LTgxZTUtOTA5OTQ5YmI3NGUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.6/10"}, {"Source": "Rotten Tomatoes", "Value": "65%"}, {"Source": "Metacritic", "Value": "56/100"}], "Metascore": "56", "imdbRating": "7.6", "imdbVotes": "587,609", "imdbID": "tt0409459", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "$107,509,799", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}, {"Title": "Stealth", "Year": "2005", "Rated": "PG-13", "Released": "29 Jul 2005", "Runtime": "121 min", "Genre": "Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi", "Director": "Rob Cohen", "Writer": "W.D.

But Baldwin's days are numbered, and strains of fanaticism, greed, and jealousy among the Crusaders threaten to shatter the truce. King Baldwin's vision of peace--a kingdom of heaven--is shared by a handful of knights, including Godfrey of Ibelin, who swear to uphold it with their lives and honor. As Godfrey passes his sword to his son, he also passes on that sacred oath: to protect the helpless, safeguard the peace, and work toward harmony between religions and cultures, so that a kingdom of heaven can flourish on earth.

Five time Oscar winner Kirk Lazarus is a serious method actor, who immerses himself in whatever the role. On location in southeast Vietnam, they are the stars of \"Tropic Thunder\", based on Vietnam war veteran 'Four Leaf' Tayback's memoirs of his rescue during the war, that rescue which was considered a near suicide mission for the assigned army force and resulted in him losing both hands. For his role, Caucasian Australian Lazarus even went through a controversial surgical skin dying procedure so that he could convincingly play a black man. Production is not going well since rookie director Damien Cockburn is unable to control the prima-donna attitude of his three stars. Cockburn and Tayback decide that the five primary actors - Speedman, Portnoy, Lazarus, rapper Alpa Chino, and newcomer Kevin Sandusky - need to work together as a unit as did their real life characters. The five are placed in the middle of the jungle, and with only a map and their prop machine guns in hand, are asked to work together to battle through the stunt pyrotechnics in their way. What none of the seven of them know is that they have been dropped into a real life drug war led by the Flaming Dragons. It isn't until Speedman is captured by the Flaming Dragons and tortured that they all realize that what they believed was make believe gunfire and land mines was actually real life. As the four actors try to figure out what to do concerning Speedman's situation, all five go through their own journey of self-discovery. Meanwhile, the movie's megalomaniacal profanity spewing producer Les Grossman and Speedman's faithful agent Rick Peck argue about what to do about Speedman's situation.

Car maker Charles Howard is no different, he who is trying to rebuild his life after the tragic death of his only child and the resulting end of his first marriage. With second wife Marcela at his side, Charles wants to get into horse racing and ends up with a team of underdogs who are also chasing their own dream. The first is trainer Tom Smith, who has a natural instinct to spot the capabilities of horses. The second is the horse Tom chooses for Charles, Seabiscuit, an unconventional choice as despite his pedigreed lineage, Seabiscuit is small at fifteen and a half hands tall with a slight limp. But Tom can see something in Seabiscuit's nature to make him a winner, if only Seabiscuit can be retrained from his inbred losing ways. And third is the jockey they decide to hire, Johnny \"Red\" Pollard, so nicknamed because of his hair color. Like Tom, Red has always shown a natural way with horses, but a difficult upbringing due solely to the Depression has made Red an angry young man, which has gotten him into trouble both on and off the track. And he is large for a jockey, and thus he always feels the need to battle the weight issue. Another common trait between Tom, Seabiscuit and Red is that they have been called crazy by those in traditional horse racing circles. Against the odds, Seabiscuit, with his human team behind him, does show his winning abilities and captures the imagination of all those others wanting to believe in a dream. But Seabiscuit's victories are at smaller races. As such, Charles aims high and wants Seabiscuit to race Triple Crown winner War Admiral, who by all accounts is a winner and should be a winner. If given the chance to race against War Admiral (whose owner doesn't want to race as he feels he has nothing to prove), will Seabiscuit and his team continue to keep the dreams of the common Americans alive? Through the good and the bad, especially as Red and Seabiscuit face mirroring problems, they all have to decide what is in their collective best interest.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "Nominated for 7 Oscars. 6 wins & 44 nominations total", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWVmMmE1YzItNGUyZS00MzgwLWFhNzYtYjM4ZTJmZDVjNmNmL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.3/10"}, {"Source": "Rotten Tomatoes", "Value": "78%"}, {"Source": "Metacritic", "Value": "72/100"}], "Metascore": "72", "imdbRating": "7.3", "imdbVotes": "77,401", "imdbID": "tt0329575", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "$120,277,854", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}, {"Title": "Bullet Train", "Year": "2022", "Rated": "R", "Released": "05 Aug 2022", "Runtime": "127 min", "Genre": "Action, Comedy, Thriller", "Director": "David Leitch", "Writer": "Zak Olkewicz, K\u00f4tar\u00f4 Isaka", "Actors": "Brad Pitt, Joey King, Aaron Taylor-Johnson", "Plot": "Trained killer Ladybug wants to give up the life but is pulled back in by his handler Maria Beetle in order to collect a briefcase on a bullet train heading from Tokyo to Morioka.

That marital status changes when on Christmas Day 1995 as Chuck is rushing off to catch yet another FedEx plane for a business trip, he gives Kelly a ring. That flight experiences technical difficulties, and goes down somewhere in the south Pacific. In a life raft, a relatively unharmed Chuck washes up on shore what he will learn is a deserted island, he unaware what has happened to any of his fellow flight mates, or the plane. However several of the packages on board for delivery do wash up on shore with him, those packages which he initially treats with respect. Chuck realizes that his priority is survival - which primarily means food, water, shelter and fire - and rescue. But survival is also in an emotional sense. To fulfill that emotional need, he has an heirloom pocket watch with Kelly's photo that she gave him as a Christmas present, and eventually opening the FedEx packages, a Wilson volleyball on which he paints a face and which he names Wilson. As time progresses, Chuck goes through a range of emotions, but if rescue is ever in the cards, he realizes that he has to find a way to get off the island, which is seemingly impossible in his circumstance due to the strong on shore surf he cannot get beyond without assistance. What Chuck may not fully realize is the longer he is not rescued, the harder it will be for him to return to his old life in its entirety if he ever is rescued.

Though Mumble's mom, Norma Jean, thinks this little habit is cute, his dad, Memphis, says it \"just ain't penguin.\" Besides, they both know that, without a Heartsong, Mumble may never find true love. As fate would have it, his one friend, Gloria, happens to be the best singer around. Mumble and Gloria have a connection from the moment they hatch, but she struggles with his strange \"hippity- hoppity\" ways. Mumble is just too different--especially for Noah the Elder, the stern leader of Emperor Land, who ultimately casts him out of the community. Away from home for the first time, Mumble meets a posse of decidedly un-Emperor-like penguins--the Adelie Amigos. Led by Ramon, the Adelies instantly embrace Mumble's cool dance moves and invite him to party with them. In Adelie Land, Mumble seeks the counsel of Lovelace the Guru, a crazy-feathered Rockhopper penguin who will answer any of life's questions for the price of a pebble. Together with Lovelace and the Amigos, Mumble sets out across vast landscapes and, after some epic encounters, proves that by being true to yourself, you can make all the difference in the world.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States, Australia", "Awards": "Won 1 Oscar. 20 wins & 26 nominations total", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWU2NDkxYjktNWVlMS00MTM4LWJjMDAtOWYxZjJkZWFhYzAxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA1NjE5MTAz._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.4/10"}, {"Source": "Rotten Tomatoes", "Value": "76%"}, {"Source": "Metacritic", "Value": "77/100"}], "Metascore": "77", "imdbRating": "6.4", "imdbVotes": "202,170", "imdbID": "tt0366548", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "$198,000,317", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}, {"Title": "Kung Fu Panda 4", "Year": "2024", "Rated": "PG", "Released": "08 Mar 2024", "Runtime": "94 min", "Genre": "Animation, Action, Adventure", "Director": "Mike Mitchell, Stephanie Stine", "Writer": "Jonathan Aibel, Glenn Berger, Darren Lemke", "Actors": "Jack Black, Awkwafina, Viola Davis", "Plot": "After Po is tapped to become the Spiritual Leader of the Valley of Peace, he needs to find and train a new Dragon Warrior, while a wicked sorceress plans to re-summon all the master villains whom Po has vanquished to the spirit re...", "Language": "Mandarin, Chinese, English", "Country": "United States, China", "Awards": "3 nominations", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY0YzI0OTctYjVhYy00MTVhLWE0NTgtYTRmYTBmOTE3YTViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMTg2ODkz._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.3/10"}, {"Source": "Rotten Tomatoes", "Value": "71%"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.3", "imdbVotes": "53,947", "imdbID": "tt21692408", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "$193,590,620", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}, {"Title": "Ocean's Eleven", "Year": "2001", "Rated": "PG-13", "Released": "07 Dec 2001", "Runtime": "116 min", "Genre": "Crime, Thriller", "Director": "Steven Soderbergh", "Writer": "George Clayton Johnson, Jack Golden Russell, Harry Brown", "Actors": "George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts", "Plot": "Danny Ocean wants to score the biggest heist in history.

But little do they know that Drac's grumpy and very old, old, old school dad Vlad is about to pay a family visit to the hotel. And when Vlad finds out that his great-grandson is not a pure blood - and humans are now welcome at Hotel Transylvania - things are going to get batty!", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States, Canada", "Awards": "3 wins & 11 nominations", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGVhZWM0YTEtM2YxYy00YWUzLWI1YWQtNjk5ZTRhNTJmM2VhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTk1MTAyODc@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.6/10"}, {"Source": "Rotten Tomatoes", "Value": "57%"}, {"Source": "Metacritic", "Value": "44/100"}], "Metascore": "44", "imdbRating": "6.6", "imdbVotes": "146,588", "imdbID": "tt2510894", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "$169,700,110", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}, {"Title": "Batman Returns", "Year": "1992", "Rated": "PG-13", "Released": "19 Jun 1992", "Runtime": "126 min", "Genre": "Action, Crime, Fantasy", "Director": "Tim Burton", "Writer": "Bob Kane, Daniel Waters, Sam Hamm", "Actors": "Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Michelle Pfeiffer", "Plot": "In the sewers of gotham city to the rooftops of the gotham city the penguin wants to know where he came from well in his villain ways catwoman plans to kill rich man of gotham max shreak but as he battles with millionaire Bruce Wayne both ladies men have their own secrets Bruce Wayne is back as Bat man trying to stop the penguin Max is helping penguin steal gotham city while selina Kyle/catwoman tries to help penguin not knowing her man murder target also her murder is helping him but all four men have their goals taking gotham from crime winning gotham city assassination for two men and more money to be gotham citys number one rich man.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States, United Kingdom", "Awards": "Nominated for 2 Oscars. 2 wins & 29 nominations total", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGZmYzVkMmItM2NiOS00MDI3LWI4ZWQtMTg0YWZkODRkMmViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODY0NzcxNw@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.1/10"}, {"Source": "Rotten Tomatoes", "Value": "82%"}, {"Source": "Metacritic", "Value": "68/100"}], "Metascore": "68", "imdbRating": "7.1", "imdbVotes": "330,903", "imdbID": "tt0103776", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "$162,924,631", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}, {"Title": "The Secret Life of Pets 2", "Year": "2019", "Rated": "PG", "Released": "07 Jun 2019", "Runtime": "86 min", "Genre": "Animation, Adventure, Comedy", "Director": "Chris Renaud, Jonathan del Val", "Writer": "Brian Lynch, Ken Daurio, Cinco Paul", "Actors": "Patton Oswalt, Kevin Hart, Harrison Ford", "Plot": "Max faces some major changes after his owner Katie gets married and now has a child.

At the village in question, Ast\u00e9rix and Ob\u00e9lix already have their hands full. Their chief has entrusted them with the task of making a man of Goudurix, his young pain in the ass nephew recently arrived from Lut\u00e8ce. And their task is far from accomplished. When Jolitorax arrives to ask for help, the Gauls decide to give him a barrel of their famous magic potion. Ast\u00e9rix and Ob\u00e9lix will accompany him back to Britain - as will Goudurix. After all, the voyage seems to offer an excellent opportunity for completing the young man's education.

The death of his wife Barbara on March 9, 1995 drove General Hummel over the edge, and now he's holding hostages in order to get his point across.

The '20s are roaring. Liquor is flowing, bullets are flying, and one man sets out to make his mark on the world. Prohibition has given rise to an endless network of underground distilleries, speakeasies, gangsters, and corrupt cops. Joe Coughlin, the youngest son of a prominent Boston police captain, has long since turned his back on his strict and proper upbringing. Now having graduated from a childhood of petty theft to a career in the pay of the city's most fearsome mobsters, Joe enjoys the spoils, thrills, and notoriety of being an outlaw. But life on the dark side carries a heavy price. In a time when ruthless men of ambition, armed with cash, illegal booze, and guns, battle for control, no one-neither family nor friend, enemy nor lover-can be trusted. Beyond money and power, even the threat of prison, one fate seems most likely for men like Joe: an early death. But until that day, he and his friends are determined to live life to the hilt. Joe embarks on a dizzying journey up the ladder of organized crime that takes him from the flash of Jazz Age Boston to the sensual shimmer of Tampa's Latin Quarter to the sizzling streets of Cuba.

In turning to Gig, a slightly shady acquaintance who operates a strip club and bar, Russ decides to turn to illegal activities to get the money he needs.

Crystal is also sleeping with her and Russ' married boss, WTPA manager Dick Simmons, in an effort to get ahead in the world. Russ, Gig and Crystal are able to devise a plan to win the next jackpot, worth $6.4 million.

He even lies to his hospitalized mother that he already owns one, with a further lie that he tells her as such primarily to make her happy, rather than the truth which is that he won't do anything to achieve that dream. One night, Max picks up a well dressed man named Vincent, who asks Max to be his only fare for the evening. For a flat fee of $600, plus an extra $100 if he gets to the airport on time - Vincent wants Max to drive him to five stops that evening. Max somewhat reluctantly agrees. Max learns the hard way at their first stop when a body falls from a third story apartment window and lands dead on top of his cab that Vincent is a contract hit man. Vincent's main goal, as per his current contract, is to kill five people, one at each of the stops, but he will not let others get in the way of that goal, even if it means killing them, including Max. As Vincent forces Max to continue driving him for the evening, Max tries slyly at every turn to take back control of his life from Vincent, especially when Max learns of one of the names on Vincent's hit list. Meanwhile, LAPD narcotics detective, Ray Fanning, and ultimately the FBI get involved when Vincent's first victim is associated with a case in which Ray is working undercover. Ray is able to piece together information which makes him hot on Max and Vincent's tail.", "Language": "English, Spanish, French, Korean", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "Nominated for 2 Oscars. 22 wins & 73 nominations total", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3NjM5OTMxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTIzMTQyMw@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.5/10"}, {"Source": "Rotten Tomatoes", "Value": "86%"}, {"Source": "Metacritic", "Value": "71/100"}], "Metascore": "71", "imdbRating": "7.5", "imdbVotes": "437,885", "imdbID": "tt0369339", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "$101,005,703", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}, {"Title": "Cats & Dogs", "Year": "2001", "Rated": "PG", "Released": "04 Jul 2001", "Runtime": "87 min", "Genre": "Action, Adventure, Comedy", "Director": "Lawrence Guterman", "Writer": "John Requa, Glenn Ficarra", "Actors": "Alec Baldwin, Tobey Maguire, Jeff Goldblum", "Plot": "A secret war between cats and dogs quickly peaks as Professor Brody a scientist tries to create a serum to cure dog allergies in humans.
